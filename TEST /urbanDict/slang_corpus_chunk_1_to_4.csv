I’m running late,I’m lagging
He’s very angry,He’s big mad
Don’t lie to me,Keep it 100
I like this outfit,This fit go crazy
She’s acting strange,She acting sus
We should leave,Let’s dip
That’s not true,That’s cap
Everything is fine,It’s Gucci

I’m nervous about this,I got the jitters
He’s good at sports,He got game
She talks too much,She be yappin
You’re right,Facts
They are lying,Straight cap
Be honest,Keep it a buck

This movie is amazing,This movie hit different
I am surprised,That caught me slippin
We have a problem,We in trouble fr
You’re really good at this,You cracked
Let’s hang out,Let’s link up
He’s not serious,He playing
This place is boring,This place dry
I’m very rich,I got bands
You made a mistake,You fumbled
This is not working,This buggy
You talk too much,You mad loud
She’s attractive,She bad
That’s unfair,That’s dirty
He’s popular,He got clout
I feel weird,I’m vibin weird
This is taking forever,This dragging
I am exhausted,I’m dead tired
You’re too slow,You moving like a snail
They’re being fake,They sus fr
I’m very confused,I’m lost AF
Let’s go quickly,Let’s slide
You're lying again,Why you always cappin
That's dangerous,That's lowkey sketchy
I don’t like this vibe,This ain’t the move
He's showing off,He flexin
I'm tired of this,I’m over it fr
You're not making sense,You speakin gibberish
It's too much effort,It’s a whole mission
This food is great,This food bussin
You’re not funny,You ain’t got jokes
That’s very old,That’s ancient
It’s too loud,It’s loud AF
He’s super fast,He zoomin
I’m feeling myself,I’m on one
He’s tough,He built diff
He’s acting emotional,He soft rn
That’s the truth,Big facts
He doesn’t care,He unbothered
You’re very kind,You a real one
He has no idea,He clueless
This isn’t important,This lowkey irrelevant
You are correct,You spittin
It’s a problem,It’s an L
I made a big mistake,I messed up big time
This is perfect,This clean AF
You’re crazy,You wild
It’s really good,It’s fire
I don’t care,I ain’t even trippin
I’m in trouble,I’m caught slippin
He’s not reliable,He flaky
You’re amazing,You the real MVP
This is a good opportunity,This a W move
I’m not paying attention,I’m zoned out
I need to rest,I gotta crash
You're very annoying,You irking
It’s way too much,That’s OD
I’m not interested in that,I’m not rockin with that
I like this a lot,This slaps
This isn’t real,This fake AF
They are a couple,They cuffed
I’m afraid,I’m shook
Let’s calm down,Let’s chill out
He’s hiding something,He lowkey sus
You’re being rude,You mad disrespectful
I feel awkward,This mad cringe
I didn’t understand that,That went over my head
She’s showing off,She flexin hard
That’s really funny,That got me weak
It’s not fair,That’s foul
He betrayed me,He switched up
You surprised me,You caught me slippin
I’m having a bad day,I’m down bad
He’s very skilled,He got hands
You’re not welcome,You not invited
You’re being dramatic,You doing the most
This is terrible,This trash
She’s ignoring me,She ghosted me
It’s awesome,It’s litty
This is basic,That’s vanilla
I got dumped,I got left on read
I was wrong,I fumbled that
That was a bad idea,That was not the move
You’re embarrassing,You making us look bad
I’m too tired,I’m beat
It’s getting intense,It’s heating up
He’s really strong,He built like a tank
She’s acting innocent,She playing sweet
It’s a secret,Keep it on the low
That’s unexpected,That came outta left field
This is expensive,This cost racks
I feel nervous,I got butterflies
He talks a lot,He don’t stop yappin
You don’t understand,You not getting it
I can’t do this anymore,I’m throwing in the towel
I’m doing well,I’m vibin
This is exciting,This got me hyped
I’m going to win,I’m catching a dub
This is confusing,This got me twisted
You look nice,You dripped out
You always help me,You got my back
It’s hard to believe,That’s wild to me
I’m proud of you,Big ups
You’re serious,You deadass
He’s ridiculous,He clownin
I’m not interested,That ain’t it chief
I don’t want to go,I’m tryna dip
This is very boring,This got no sauce
You are awesome,You a real one fr
It’s obvious,That’s a given
Be quiet,Zip it
It’s suspicious,That’s sketch AF
He’s always complaining,He stay whining
That’s unbelievable,That’s straight up wild
It’s old-fashioned,That’s boomer talk
I’m uncomfortable,I’m not vibing
It’s unnecessary,That’s extra for no reason
I like your outfit,That fit fresh
